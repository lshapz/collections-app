This is an app for managing collections of Pokemon and/or Magic the Gathering cards. There is also a deckbuilding component (the decks are not limited to playable decks for the card games). It was written as a Rails final project at the Flatiron School.

Major dependencies include the ruby gems we used to access the respective APis, https://github.com/PokemonTCG/pokemon-tcg-sdk-ruby and https://github.com/MagicTheGathering/mtg-sdk-ruby.

Current to-do:

Deckbuilding:
  - Create a new deck
    - belongs_to collection, so has access to cards only through that collection
    - assign a name
 Â   - form will iterate through all cards while iterating through **each** card (card.count.times do...)
      - each card has a checkbox
    - submit

Refactor:
  - most controllers #create and #update actions
